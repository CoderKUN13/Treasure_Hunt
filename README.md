This is a program that will mark a spot on a map with an X.

In the code, you will find a variable called map.

This map contains a nested list. When map is printed this is what it looks like, notice the nesting:

[['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']]

I've used this line of code to format the 3 lists to be printed as a 3 by 3 grid, each on a new line.

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
